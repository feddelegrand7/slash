Description: Allows users to list data structures using path-based navigation. 
    Provides intuitive methods for storing, accessing,
    and manipulating nested data through simple path strings.
    Key features include strict mode validation, path existence checking, recursive
    operations, and automatic parent-level creation. Designed for use cases requiring
    organized storage of complex nested data while maintaining simple access patterns.
    Particularly useful for configuration management, nested settings, and any
    application where data naturally forms a tree-like structure.
